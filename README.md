# Exceptions_OatmealCookie
There's a pile of normal cookies but with one Oatmeal cookie, can you find it?

To run, simply run the .EXE file.

This is a game where 2 players must compete to find the Oatmeal cookie within the cookie pile.
There are 9 total cookies, with one randomly being the Oatmeal cookie.
Cookies are designated as 1-9, so only the number is required to select the cookie. ex: '4' for Cookie 4.
There are two players with the active player displayed on screen. The turn ends for that player regardless if they select an already eaten cookie.
The player who finds the Oatmeal cookie wins, and the program will terminate.

*Learning experience: Error handling through use of "Try, Catch, Finally" blocks.
